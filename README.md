- **Key Features**:  
  - Implemented and evaluated algorithms including:  
    - Random Forest  
    - Logistic Regression  
    - Naive Bayes models (Bernoulli, Multinomial, Gaussian)  
  - Achieved the highest accuracy of **95.45%** with the Random Forest algorithm.  
  - Designed an interactive GUI using Tkinter for user-friendly interaction and result display.  
- **Outcome**: Identified Random Forest as the most accurate model for spam prediction.
